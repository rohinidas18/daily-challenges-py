# Time Taken by Ant to Gather Food
# An ant has its nest in a tree which is at the bottom of a mountain. The mountain is irregular 
# in structure that to travel from one point in the mountain to the other point in the mountain 
# one has to climb up, move straight and climb down. Everyday this ant get down the tree, searches 
# for food in the mountain and brings back the food to the nest. Ant moves with different speeds 
# while it climbs down the tree, climbs up the tree, climbs down the mountain, climbs up the 
# mountain and move straight on the mountain surface. Let P be the point in the mountain where 
# food for the ant is available on a particular day.

# Given the height of the tree, the distances to climb up, climb down and move straight to reach 
# the point P from the nest of the ant and the different speeds with which the ant can move, 
# determine the time taken by the ant to gather food from point P and save it in its nest. All the 
# distances given in the problem are in meters and the speed of ant is given in meters/min. After 
# calculation, ceil the time taken to next minute. Ceil function gives the next integer for all 
# decimal places that is ceil(3.1) = 4 and ceil(3.9) = 4.

# For example, if the height of the tree is 230 meters, to reach point P from the bottom tree the 
# ant has to climb up 170 meters, move straight by 310 meters, climb down 217 meters and the ant 
# can climb down the tree with speed 8 m/min, climb up the mountain with speed 6 m/min, move 
# straight on mountain surface with speed 11m/min, climb down the mountain with speed 12 m/min 
# and the ant can climb up the tree with speed 7m/min then the time taken by the ant to bring 
# food to nest will be 3 hours and 35 minutes.

# In python, ceil function for a variable ‘x’ may be used as
# import math
# math.ceil(x)

# Input Format
# First line contains the height of the tree, h
# Next line contains the distance to climb up to reach point P
# Next line contains the distance to move straight to reach point P
# Next line contains the distance to climb down to reach point P
# Next line contains the speed of the ant by which it can climb up the mountain
# Next line contains the speed of the ant by which it can climb down the mountain
# Next line contains the speed of the ant by which it can move straight on the mountain surface
# Next line contains the speed of the ant by which it can climb up the tree
# Next line contains the speed of the ant by which it can climb down the tree

# Output Format
# Print the number of hours and minutes (ceil to the next minute and separated by a space) taken 
# by the ant to gather food from point P and bring back to the nest
