# Number of Weeks to Get a Video Game
# Varun likes to get a video game of cost Rs. x, but his father doesnâ€™t want to 
# get him immediately. So he tells varun that he will give a pockey money of Rs. p 
# every week which he can save and get the game. But varun wanted to get it faster 
# so he pleaded his father to increase the pocket money evey week by Rs. q. 
# His father agrees. Given the cost of the video game, x, pocket money initially decided p, 
# increase in pocket money every week q, write a code to find the number of weeks that 
# varun will take to get the video game.

# For example, if the cost of the video game is Rs. 100, initial pocket money agreed 
# is Rs. 20 and increase in pocket money agreed for every week is Rs. 2 then varun will 
# take 5 weeks to get the video game.
